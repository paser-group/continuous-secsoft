## Introduction 

Integrated development environments (IDEs) play a pivotal role in developing software in a secure fashion. As part of this research project, you will be using generative AI (GenAI) tools to identify the properties that are unique to IDEs and make them different to that of traditional software systems. You will also be learning from GenAI tools on the security vulnerabilities within IDEs that could have severe consequences. 


## Tasks 

### Task-1

- Create a chain of thought prompt to query a GenAI tool on the properties that make IDEs unique *and* different to traditional software systems. 
- Apply the prompt with the following free versions of GenAI tools:
  - Claude 
  - Gemini 
  - ChatGPT
- From the output identify the property name, definition, and the rationale provided for the property 
- Using the data generated from the steps above, please complete the following table. The `ReportedBy` column is the name of the LLM that reported the property.  It is OK to include multiple LLMs to report the same property. Save the table in a Markdown file, and upload it on CANVAS. 


| Name  | Definition | Rationale | ReportedBy |
|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |


### Task-2

- Create a chain of thought prompt to query a GenAI tool on the security vulnerabilities that can have serious consequences for IDEs. The prompt should include content on the location of the IDE. 
- Apply the prompt with the following free versions of GenAI tools:
  - Claude 
  - Gemini 
  - ChatGPT
- From the output identify the vulnerability name, definition, consequence, location, and the rationale provided for the property 
- Using the data generated from the steps above, please complete the following table. The `ReportedBy` column is the name of the LLM that reported the problem. It is OK to include multiple LLMs to report the same security vulnerability. Save the table in a Markdown file, and upload it on CANVAS. 


| Name  | Definition | Consequence | Rationale | ReportedBy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |


## Deliverables 

- Two Markdown files 
- One TEXT file with the prompts used in Task-1 and 2 
- All output generated from the LLMs for Task-1 and Task-2 respectively, in `TASK1.txt` and `TASK2.txt`
