# ANGR - A Binary Analysis Tool That Performs Symbolic Execution 

### Background 

ANGR is a tool to implement concolic execution and symbolic execution.  

### Tasks For You To Complete 

Create a Python program that extracts the following information for all binaries in the `binaries.tar.gz` file. 

- The control flow graph 
- Number of nodes in the control flow graph 
- Number of edges in the control flow graph
- Memory ranges for all objects
- Address of the memory where the process heap object for the binary is stored


### Deliverables
- Code to achieve the above-mentioned five tasks: [50%] 
- The output: [50%]
