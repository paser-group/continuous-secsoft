# Install and configure base swift components
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*swift_hash_path_suffix*]
#   (Required) String. A suffix used by hash_path to offer a bit more security
#   when generating hashes for paths. It simply appends this value to all
#   paths; if someone knows this suffix, it's easier for them to guess the hash
#   a path will end up with. New installations are advised to set this
#   parameter to a random secret, which would not be disclosed ouside the
#   organization. The same secret needs to be used by all swift servers of the
#   same cluster. Existing installations should set this parameter to an empty
#   string.
#
# [*swift_hash_path_prefix*]
#   (Required) String. A prefix used by hash_path to offer a bit more security
#   when generating hashes for paths. It simply prepends this value to all paths;
#   if someone knows this prefix, it's easier for them to guess the hash a path
#   will end up with. New installations are advised to set this parameter to a
#   random secret, which would not be disclosed ouside the organization. The
#   same secret needs to be used by all swift servers of the same cluster.
#   Existing installations should set this parameter to an empty string.
#   as a salt when hashing to determine mappings in the ring.
#   This file should be the same on every node in the cluster.
#
# [*package_ensure*]
#   (Optional) The ensure state for the swift package.
#   Defaults to present.
#
# [*client_package_ensure*]
#   (Optional) The ensure state for the swift client package.
#   Defaults to present.
#
# [*max_header_size*]
#   (Optional) Max HTTP header size for incoming requests for all swift
#   services. Recommended size is 32768 for PKI keystone tokens.
#   Defaults to 8192
