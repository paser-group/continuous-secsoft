# Resource to serve Heat API with apache mod_wsgi in place of heat-api service.

#
# When using this class you should disable your heat-api service.
#
# == Parameters
#
#   [*port*]
#     The port for the specific API.
#
#   [*servername*]
#     The servername for the virtualhost.
#     Optional. Defaults to $::fqdn
#
#   [*bind_host*]
#     The host/ip address Apache will listen on.
#     Optional. Defaults to undef (listen on all ip addresses).
#
#   [*path*]
#     The prefix for the endpoint.
#     Optional. Defaults to '/'
#
#   [*ssl*]
#     Use ssl ? (boolean)
#     Optional. Defaults to true
#
#   [*workers*]
#     Number of WSGI workers to spawn.
#     Optional. Defaults to $::os_workers
#
#   [*priority*]
#     (optional) The priority for the vhost.
#     Defaults to '10'
#
#   [*threads*]
#     (optional) The number of threads for the vhost.
#     Defaults to 1
#
#   [*ssl_cert*]
#   [*ssl_key*]
#   [*ssl_chain*]
#   [*ssl_ca*]
#   [*ssl_crl_path*]
#   [*ssl_crl*]
#   [*ssl_certs_dir*]
#     apache::vhost ssl parameters.
#     Optional. Default to apache::vhost 'ssl_*' defaults.
#
#   [*access_log_file*]
#     The log file name for the virtualhost.
#     Optional. Defaults to false.
#
#   [*access_log_format*]
#     The log format for the virtualhost.
#     Optional. Defaults to false.
#
#   [*error_log_file*]
#     The error log file name for the virtualhost.
#     Optional. Defaults to undef.
#
#   [*custom_wsgi_process_options*]
#     (optional) gives you the oportunity to add custom process options or to
#     overwrite the default options for the WSGI main process.
#     eg. to use a virtual python environment for the WSGI process
#     you could set it to:
#     { python-path => '/my/python/virtualenv' }
#     Defaults to {}
#
#   [*wsgi_process_display_name*]
#     (optional) Name of the WSGI process display-name.
#     Defaults to undef
