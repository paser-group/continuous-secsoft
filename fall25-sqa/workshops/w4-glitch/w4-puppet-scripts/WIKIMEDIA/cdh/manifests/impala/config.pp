# == Class cdh::impala::config
# Special config class for impala.  This class only exists to deal with
# puppet annoyances, and should not be directly included.
#
# Impala requires that it have hive-site.xml, core-site.xml
# and hdfs-site.xml in /etc/impala/conf.  Both hive-site.xml and core-site.xml
# should be identical to the ones used by Hive and Hadoop, so we can just
# symlink to those in the cdh::impala class.
# However, Impala has its own hdfs client (written in C++), so it needs
# some special client level settings.  We don't want to duplicate the
# Hadoop properties or the template, so instead, we inherit directly
# from cdh::hadoop, and render a new hdfs-site.xml file with
# all of the inherited properties from hadoop.
# Also, since this class must be evaluated before cdh::impala, and we need
# to know the Impala $config_directory and alternative we are going to use,
# this class is called ::config instead of ::hadoop, and configures
# the $config_directory and alternative.  cdh::impala sets its own
# $config_directory variable that can be refereced from other places
# that need to know it.  Do not try to reference anything in this class!
#
