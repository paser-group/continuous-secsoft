# Workshop for Pairwise Testing 

Here, we will work with the [bandit tool](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to get a flavor of combinatorial interaction testing. Here we will use the tool to scan Python scripts in `w12.zip`. This will be referred to as the target for this workshop. 

## Tasks for You 

- Understand the `-a`, `-l`, `-i`, `-f` flags and the configurations for Bandit using `bandit -h`
- Use the [allpairspy](https://github.com/thombashi/allpairspy) library to generate test cases using all of the four configurations. Please all output generated from allpairspy to create these test cases.  Use the generated test cases to run Bandit with the target, i.e., w12.zip. 
- Record the execution of all generated test cases for these four configurations. 

> Due Nov 20, 2025 

## Deliverables 
- Your execution of each test cases for combinations generated by `allpairspy`  [50%]
- Your Python code where you use `allpairspy` [50%]
