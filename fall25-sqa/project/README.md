## Project for Software Quality Assurance (COMP 5710/6710) 

### Objective 

The objective of this project is to integrate software quality assurance activities into an existing Python project. Whatever we learned from our workshops will be integrated in the project. 

### Activities 

1. Unpack the project `MLForensics.zip`. (1%)
2. Upload project as a GitHub repo on `github.com`. Format of the repo name is `TEAMNAME-FALL2025-SQA`  (2%)
3. In your project repo create `README.md` listing your team name and team members. (2%)
4. Apply the following activities related to software quality assurance:
   - 4.a. Create a `fuzz.py` file that will automatically fuzz 5 Python methods of your choice. Report any bugs you discovered by the `fuzz.py` file. `fuzz.py` will be automatically executed from GitHub actions. (25%)

   - 4.b. Integrate forensics using logging statements by modifying 5 Python methods of your choice. (25%)

   - 4.c. Integrate continuous integration with GitHub Actions. (25%)   

5. Report your activities and lessons learned. Put the report in your repo as `SQA-REPO.md` (20%)   


### Deliverables 

1. A repo hosted on GitHub. Name of the repo will be `TEAMNAME-FALL2025-SQA` 
2. Full completion of all activities as recorded on the GitHub repository 
3. Report describing what activities your performed and what you have learned 
4. Code, logs, and screenshots that show execution of forensics, fuzzing, and continuous integration
5. In the case of continuous integration (CI), provide the location of the build.   
6. One person from the team will submit the URL of the repository on CANVAS
